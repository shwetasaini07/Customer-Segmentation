### Problem Statement 
- Customer segmentation involves categorizing customers into distinct groups according to specific traits or spending behaviors. The process of clustering is essential because it fosters a mutually beneficial outcome for both customers and stores. By identifying the right customers for particular products, offers, and services, stores can cater to their preferences and needs effectively.
- Consequently, customers experience a more personalized and tailored shopping experience, leading to increased customer satisfaction and demand. This, in turn, results in higher revenue and business growth for the stores.

### Approach 
- Employing unsupervised clustering algorithms in Machine Learning, we create customer clusters to discern distinct customer types.
- In this clustering problem, I will utilize supervised machine learning algorithms like KMeans Clustering to achieve accurate customer segmentation.

### Libraries Used 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn

### Visualization
